## Why

Just using these problems to teach some of my non-strictly-programmer friends about solving problems, algorithms and data structures.
Code should be fairly readable, there might be some italian variable names here and there

## Running it

Using just the standard library so as long as you have go installed all you need to do is `go run main.go` in one of the problem folders
